# BITS Pilani WILP Cheatsheet 2022-2024 Batch

This is the Public Repo counterpart where you have access to most stuff. The private stuff are usually for my self-study, which may either confuse you guys or lead me into trouble. So I have kept them separate in a [private GitHub repo](https://github.com/anushibin007/bits-wilp-2022-2024-private). Hit me up if you would like to see any of those stuff. I will share you the details on a need-only basis.

# About Me
I am an M.Tech Software Systems 2022 - 2024 Batch Student with specialization in IoT. I have made this page free and public for all. If you would like to thank me, please give a visit to my [tiny YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQQPAdiX_k0JE0eGCUzDPzQ) and drop a sub **only** if you liked the content there.
